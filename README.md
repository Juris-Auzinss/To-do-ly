# To-do-ly

To-do list app

Created for training and determining my abilities level of Front-End,
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL.

A simple To-Do-List application, with three main features:

- list of all tasks.
- foom to add a new task.
- form to edit a specific task.

A new task form is displayed when the "+ Add new Job.." button is clicked.

Each task has data:

- Title
- Description
- unique ID
- date created.

Each task has a checkbox (complete button), edit task button, and delete task button.

I would like to make all tasks ordered from latest to oldest. And the complete tasks should move to the back of the list.

Page is responsive and does not use any libraries or frameworks.
